# Dashboard UI & API

> This component is a work in progress! 

The dashboard uses Next.js and Chakra UI to create an interactive dashboard to manage Hypixel bot(s) and view chat logs. It also fetches messages from a back-end using an API (found in `src/pages/api`).

## Workspace Layout

This application is split into separate components and organized into folders. A list of folders can be found below:
