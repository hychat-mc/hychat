# Hypixel Bot

> This component is a work in progress! 

This component is mostly a fork/migration of code from [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot), and adapted to TypeScript. It is written in a way that it can be scaled up easily to multiple users. It is heavily integrated with the back-end database, and the Discord bot itself.
