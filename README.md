# Dashboard UI & API

> This component is a work in progress! 

The dashboard uses Next.js and TailwindCSS to create an interactive dashboard to manage Hypixel bot(s) and view chat logs. It also fetches messages from a back-end using an API (found in `src/pages/api`).

## Branches

This application is split into seperate components and organised into branches. A list of branches can be found below:
