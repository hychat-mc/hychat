# Welcome to Hypixel Guild Chat Bot 2.0 (TS)

This application is a WIP, and is the "2nd edition" to [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot).

2.0 was created by [EvernoteMC](https://github.com/EvernoteMC), which is a semi-fork of Hypixel Guild Chat Bot. Jejebecarte and I (xMdb) will be developing the bot and adding new features, as Evernote is currently on academic break until April 2022.

## Workspace Layout

This application is split into separate components and organized into folders. A list of folders can be found below:

- [üñ•Ô∏è dashboard: Dashboard UI & API](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-ts/tree/master/dashboard)
- [ü§ñ discord: Discord Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-ts/tree/master/discord)
- [‚õèÔ∏è mineflayer: Hypixel Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-ts/tree/master/mineflayer)

## Installation

This application uses a Supabase (PostgreSQL) back-end and the components are meant to work together with the same database. If you wish to install a single component, see that component's README.

If you wish to use a simplier version, see [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot).
