> ⚠️ **Hychat is currently in early alpha and in active development. It currently is non-functional and not recommended for use.**

Welcome! Hychat is **the** guild chat bridge to end all other guild chat bridges.

## Huh? What's Hychat?

It is common for each top Hypixel guild to have their own developer who makes yet *another* guild chat bridge. Not all guild bridges are created equally. Some might be basic or be fully featured. We aim to create a unified experience for all guilds, so that **everyone can enjoy the same great experience**. This will include bot management via a web interface, full customization, reliable infrastructure, and a whole lot more.

## Ok, cool, but who's making it?

Our current team consists of a few developers who've all created their own version of a guild chat bridge in either JavaScript or Python. We've combined our knowledge of Minecraft/Hypixel bots and our developer experiences to create Hychat. These people include:

- [xMdb](https://github.com/xMdb), creator of [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot), used in [Hypixel Knights](https://discord.gg/hk) (#16) and others
- [Evernote](https://github.com/EvernoteMC), creator of [Hypixel Guild Chat Py](https://github.com/EvernoteMC/hypixel-guild-chat-py), used in [Infamy](https://hypixel.net/threads/832779/) (#60) and others
- [Jejebecarte](https://github.com/Jejebecarte), creator of [MiscGuild's BridgeBot](https://github.com/MiscGuild/BridgeBot), used in [Miscellaneous](https://miscguild.xyz/) (#18) and others

> If you've made your own guild chat bridge before and would like to contribute, contact us through [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/hychatmc) or via email at *hychat [at] hych.at*.

## Features

- **Most (if not all) of the features of the original [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot) re-implemented to be more efficient and easier to use.**
  - Includes the guild chat bridge (sends all guild messages), logs guild joins and leaves, and automatic recovery.
- Create and deploy your own bot with a couple of clicks via the dashboard.
- Automatic setup via a Discord bot.
- Manage your guild via commands or the dashboard.
- **More to be announced!**

## How Does It Work?

We combine multiple components written in TypeScript such as the backend, Mineflayer bot(s), Discord bot, and web interface, to 

## Who's it for?

This application is for anyone! As long as you have a spare **premium** Minecraft account that can be used to play on Hypixel, you can create your bot in no time!
