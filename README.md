# Welcome to Hychat

This application is a WIP, and is the "2nd edition" to [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot).

2.0 was created by [EvernoteMC](https://github.com/EvernoteMC), which is a semi-fork of Hypixel Guild Chat Bot. Jejebecarte and I (xMdb) will be developing the bot and adding new features, as Evernote is currently on academic break until April 2022.

## Workspace Layout

This application is split into separate components and organized into folders. A list of folders can be found below:
