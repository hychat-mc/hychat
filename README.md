# Welcome to Hypixel Guild Chat Bot 2.0 (TS)

The dashboard uses Next.js and TailwindCSS to create an interactive dashboard to manage Hypixel bot(s) and view chat logs. It also fetches messages from a back-end using an API (found in `src/pages/api`).

2.0 was created by [EvernoteMC](https://github.com/EvernoteMC), which is a semi-fork of Hypixel Guild Chat Bot. Jejebecarte and I (xMdb) will be developing the bot and adding new features, as Evernote is currently on academic break until April 2022.

## Branches

This application is split into seperate components and organised into branches. A list of branches can be found below:

## Installation

This application uses a Supabase (PostgreSQL) back-end and the components are meant to work together with the same database. If you wish to install a single component, see that component's README.

If you wish to use a simplier version, see [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot).
