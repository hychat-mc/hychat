# Hypixel Bot

> This component is a work in progress! 

This component is mostly a fork/migration of code from [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot), and adapted to TypeScript. It is written in a way that it can be scaled up easily to multiple users.

## Branches

This application is split into seperate components and organised into branches. A list of branches can be found below:
