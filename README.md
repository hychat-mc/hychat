# Hypixel Guild Chat Bot 2.0 (TS)

[![Commit Activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-ts)](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-ts/commits/main/)

This application is a WIP, and is the "2nd edition" to [Hypixel Guild Chat Bot](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot).

2.0 was created by [EvernoteMC](https://github.com/EvernoteMC), which is a semi-fork of Hypixel Guild Chat Bot. I (xMdb) will be maintaining the bot and its code, as Evernote is currently on academic break until April 2022.

> ℹ️ This application will login to Hypixel using Mineflayer which is not a normal Minecraft client, this could result in your Minecraft account getting banned from Hypixel, so use this application at your own risk.
